Go Concurrency Challenge
Welcome to the Go Concurrency Challenge repository! This challenge is designed to help you explore the fascinating world of Go concurrency, where you'll learn about goroutines, channels, and concurrent programming in the Go programming language.

What is Concurrency?
Concurrency is the concept of executing multiple tasks independently but not necessarily simultaneously. In Go, we achieve concurrency through goroutines, which are lightweight, user-mode threads that allow us to execute functions concurrently.

What You Will Learn
In this challenge, you will dive into the following topics:

1.Goroutines: Learn how to create, manage, and synchronize goroutines to perform tasks concurrently.

2.Channels: Understand how to use channels for communication and data synchronization between goroutines. Learn about different channel types and how to send and receive data.

3.Concurrency Patterns: Explore common concurrency patterns, such as fan-out/fan-in, worker pools, and select statements.

4.Best Practices: Discover best practices for writing clean and efficient concurrent Go code.
